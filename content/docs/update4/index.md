Fixing bugs 
---
We fixed a lot of bugs, mostly that are connected to game saving/loading
- Your increased stats were not loading properly.
- Fixed UI bugs like the previously implemented mission board, and the mission panels
- Fixed the issue with the fish pull out animations, they weren't adjusted properly. 
- And all of the balancing issues have now been resolved? Testing the game on two occasions for 3+ hours and my gosh the game still keeps us entertained... Guess that's a good thing.

Steam demo feedback
---

We got some feedback on our steam demo regarding the controls, on keyboard and mouse. 

So the idea is to add subtle hints how to use the inventory, and increase the ease of use by making each button clickable and toggleable. 

It's a long road ahead to make the controls feel as best as possible, we're not trying to reinvent the wheel here and make people uncomfortable by having ridiculous controls, but still, we want to make this perfect!

Questions about the release date
---
Also to answer a lot of questions about the release date: The game will be released Q1 2025 in early access, we're not comfortable with providing the exact date, even though we do have one, we don't want to disappoint people if we eventually need to push it back further. We will announce the release date once we are sure that it's ready.

What's next?
---
Well we are preparing most of the story missions and the side ones.

We've received a lot of feedback regarding the story feeling awkward so we're changing the dialogue to feel a lot more alive and lifelike. Since with the demo we were rushing to prepare everything for Steam Next Fest, we acknowledge that we didn't really put the desired effort in and that it needs to be implemented correctly in order to feel a lot better.

The story line will stay the same as per plan, but the dialogues will change just a bit. 

{{< carousel images="missions/*" aspectRatio="16-9" interval="2500" >}}

We've also decided to reduce the number of side missions with dialogue, and instead focus on gameplay oriented missions. What that means is that instead of having long conversations with characters with different choices, there will be more fish catching auctions, building to help other villagers. 

The reason for this is to reduce the number of fetch missions with dialogue, and instead offer a reward for being a good fisherman and a treasure hunter. 

With these changes you'd think that we're changing a big part of the game... And we agree it's pretty sudden change that will effect how the game is played, but that what the demo is for, feedback you guys give is really valuable to us to see the bigger picture and from a different angle, but we are not changing a whole lot, a lot of these story missions weren't implemented fully so replacing them will be just fine. 

Finding the right balance between different types of missions is key to making the game feel a lot better.

We listen and want to make the game as best it could be.

We also have plans to make the events until the next update, some days of the week will be different types of events.

Fishing a certain type of fish or a different special event that will increase your leaderboard position.

But that's for another update, thanks for reading and for the support üíù
