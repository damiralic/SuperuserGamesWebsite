Hello everyone! This is our very first post about Fisherman's Palace.

We are so very proud that we actually got the steam page up and running, and everything went smoothly without any issues.

{{< alert "steam" >}}
If you haven't already, [WISHLIST](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2749370/Fishermans_Palace/) the game on steam.

So if you don't know what Fisherman's Palace is, it's a fishing game that is based around fishing competitions, building, farming and interacting with the fellow villager. 

We are trying to bridge the gap and make fishing finally fun to play by introducing fishing competition around the village, you will be competing with the villagers to 
be crowned the best in the village.

But also you will want to catch them all because there is more than 90 species of fish.

Our current roadmap looks like this:

{{< timelineItem icon="steam" header="Publish steam page" badge="steam" >}}
Focus on getting the steam page up and running, making a trailer and adding some nice images of the game.

{{< timelineItem icon="code" header="Finishing the main core of the game" badge="coding" >}}
We don't have that much left to code out, we have already made the leaderboards, which marks the end of the development cylcle of the game.
What's left is fixing loads of bugs, testing, and switching things up.

{{< timelineItem icon="globe" header="Marketing the game" badge="marketing" >}}
Obviously everyone knows that if you don't tell people about your game, no one will know about your game. So we must shift some of our time towards the marketing of the game.
