So Whatâ€™s New?

We've been focusing on expanding your gear and crafting options. Now, you can create a variety of items to enhance your experience.
- **Progression System** â€“ Levels have been introduced to streamline progression. With each level, you'll unlock new buildings and upgrades for your plot.
- **Fishing & Crafting Enhancements** â€“ You can now turn fish into fish guts, which are used to craft baits and incenses. Extract fish eggs, breed new species, or raise them from eggs to big strong fish!
- **Farming Refinery** â€“ This new system allows you to grind plants into plant mill, a key ingredient for bait and incense crafting.
- **Expanded Workbenches** â€“ You can refine fish in multiple ways to maximize your fishing potential.

- **Houses** - Increase your inventory space.
- **Props** - Customize your plot with decorations.
- **Farming Plots** - Grow plants for crafting materials.
- **Boosters** - Structures that enhance your farm (e.g., beehives make crops grow faster!).
