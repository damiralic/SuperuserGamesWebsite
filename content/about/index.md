We are boyfriend Damir and girlfriend Ivana making our first commercial game.

Damir took a year off college to process what he wanted to do with his career and life in general. And that is where he decided he wanted to try to make his first game.

Since childhood, he liked making games for himself, his friends, and his brother. When he showed that to Ivana she was so impressed and pushed him forward to places he couldn't even imagine. Making more serious projects and finally Fisherman's Palace.

Ivana dropped out of college two years ago, she decided that wasn't for her, and she wanted to pursue something a lot more creative.

Since she was a child she loved doing anything creative, she played piano and guitar, but what interested her the most was painting landscapes. That transitioned into a love for world design.

Together they started working on a lot of different projects to learn as much as they could and improve.

In October of 2023. They decided it was time to start working on a commercial game and that is Fisherman's Palace.
